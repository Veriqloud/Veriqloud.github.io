# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation site for our Secure Storage Software : **Qasmat**.

---

Qasmat is a secure distributed storage system based on Shamir's Secret Sharing to split files into pieces and store them on a network of storage servers. It ensures data availability even when some servers are offline, without compromising security as in traditional redundancy. The system prevents an attacker having access to some servers from gaining information on the protected files.

This documentation provides information on how to install and  use the software along with explanations on its security features and how it works. 

It follows the [di√°taxis approach](https://diataxis.fr/): the documentation is split into four parts corresponding to different needs.
